    "# Configuring an ARIMA Model\n",
    "# The classical approach for fitting an ARIMA model is to follow the Box-Jenkins Methodology.\n",
    "# This is a process that uses time series analysis and diagnostics to discover good parameters \n",
    "# for the ARIMA model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In summary, the steps of this process are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Model Identification. Use plots and summary statistics to identify trends, seasonality, \n",
    "# and autoregression elements to get an idea of the amount of differencing and the size of the lag \n",
    "# that will be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Parameter Estimation. Use a fitting procedure to find the coefficients of the regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Model Checking. Use plots and statistical tests of the residual errors to determine the amount \n",
    "# and type of temporal structure not captured by the model.\n",
    "# The process is repeated until either a desirable level of fit is achieved on the in-sample \n",
    "# or out-of-sample observations (e.g. training or test datasets)."
